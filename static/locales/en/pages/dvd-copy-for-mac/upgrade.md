## Upgrade policy

**Pay to upgrade to <item-info :handlename="handleName"></item-info> now and enjoy one-year free upgrades of its future versions!**

The new customers who have purchased DVD-Cloner for less than one year can upgrade to <item-info :handlename="handleName"></item-info> or later versions for free within the year!

If it exceeds one year, you need to pay for next year's upgrade service. If you do not want to upgrade, you can still use the original version without time limit!
