### Q: I am unable to make a copy that works like the original DVD

A:
Please try other functions in expert interface, such as "1:1" or "movie only" option and unclick "enable smart analyser" in Advanced Setup. Or you may select the expert mode and click the folder button on the second line to choose a hard disk drive (HDD) to save the movie. Then you can rip the DVD movie to your HD. If the video files play fine from the HD, then you can burn it to the blank disk with NERO.
