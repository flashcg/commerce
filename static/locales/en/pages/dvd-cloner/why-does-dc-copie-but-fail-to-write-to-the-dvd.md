### Q: Why does DC copie but fail to write to the dvd?

A:
Please try the steps:

1 Please make sure that your DVD burner supports the DVDr/rw disc you use.

2 Please select 4x or 1x as burning speed in the Advanced Option and use 4x namebrand DVDr/rw disc, such as Memorex, Fujifilm, or Verbatim for example.

3 If you use DVDrw disc, please format it before burning.

4 Please select your hard drive as target and backup your DVD on your hard drive. Then you may burn from HDD to DVDr/rw disc with Nero or roxio.
