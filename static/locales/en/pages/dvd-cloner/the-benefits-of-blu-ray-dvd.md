### Q: What are the benefits of Blu-ray DVD?

A:
Obviously the major benefit of Blu-ray DVD's is that it is able to hold more data on one disc, therefore allowing high definition audio and video. The more data you have, the more data can be read to give a clearer picture with more color and vividness.
One of the benefits of Blu-ray technology is that because data is so close together, early types of Blu-ray discs would be contaminated by slight scratches. However, a new coating has been developed that makes Blu-ray discs extremely difficult to scratch.
