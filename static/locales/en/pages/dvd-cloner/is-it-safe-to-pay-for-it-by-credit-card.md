### Q: Is it safe to pay for it by credit card?

A:
If you feel worried about paying for it by credit card, you can choose to pay by check/money or order by phone.
If you want to pay by check/money, please click the "buy" button on the software which will lead you to the SWREG's order page. You can find the check/money order/wire/paypal option there.
To order with money order is quiet easy. Just select "order at SWREG.ORG",then follow the link, select "CHECK by US or UK checks or International Money Orders" option. You will get all information about buying with "money order/check".
