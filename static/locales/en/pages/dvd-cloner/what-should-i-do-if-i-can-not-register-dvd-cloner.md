### Q: What should I do if I can not register DVD-Cloner?

A:
DVD-Cloner needs to be registered on-line. If DVD-Cloner can not be registered successfully, please click here to register with the manual key. 
Take DVD-Cloner V6.00 for example, the default setting of the server is "Main server". If you can't register successfully after entering your Code and Email address, you can try the "Backup Server".
