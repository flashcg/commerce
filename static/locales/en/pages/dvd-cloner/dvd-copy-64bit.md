### Comparison chart of the copy time (DVD-Cloner 64-bit vs. DVD-Cloner 32-bit)

Copy time may vary with your computer configuration, burn speed and the contents of the movie. We recently performed a test of copying a DVD-9 movie (_The Golden Compass, 8.0GB_) to a DVD-5 disc respectively with DVD-Cloner 64-bit and DVD-Cloner 32-bit. It took about 55 minutes for DVD-Cloner 32-bit to finish the DVD copy while the copy time for DVD-Cloner 64-bit is only about 35 minutes, much faster than DVD-Cloner 32-bit!

### Knowledge about DVD-Cloner 64-bit

[What is 64-bit computing?]({kbUrl}about-64-bit/what-is-64-bit-computing.html)

64-bit refers to the bits number that can be processed or transmitted in parallel or bits number used for single element in a data format. While 64-bit computing is the use of processors that have data path widths, integer size, and memory addresses of 64 bits wide. A 64-bit register can store 264 different values and a processor with 64-bit memory addresses can directly access 264 bytes of memory. A 64-bit CPU can handle much more memory and larger files than a 32-bit CPU. 32-bit computer systems can only hold up to 4GB of RAM while 64-bit computer systems can hold up to 1000GB of memory. So 64-bit desktop systems keep ahead of 32-bit desktop systems in many aspects, especially for larger storage capacity and higher performance speed.

[Can 64-bit programs run on a 32-bit computer?]({kbUrl}about-64-bit/can-64-bit-programs-run-on-a-32-bit-computer.html)
If the program is specifically designed for the 64-bit version of Windows, it won't work on the 32-bit version of Windows. However, most 32-bit programs will work on the 64-bit version of Windows, except for some antivirus programs. Meanwhile, 64-bit device drivers won't work on computers running a 32-bit version of Windows.
