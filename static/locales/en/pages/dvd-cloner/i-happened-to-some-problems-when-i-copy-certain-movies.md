### Q: I happened to some problems when I copy certain movies?

A:

You may choose other options to solve the problem, such as "Split D9 to two D5 discs" or "1:1" option .

Some DVD is too large to backup on 1 D5 disc and caused audio-and-video synchronous. You may select complete 1:1 disc copy, which will make a 1:1 copy without any quality loss. Please have a try.

Please note a D9 movie need a D9 blank disc to make 1:1 copy. Or try Split D9 to 2 D5 discs.
