### Q: Can I copy my preferred sections rather than the whole DVD?

A:
Of course you can.

You can choose any chapter you want to copy without copying the whole movie. 
When you select "Customized copy" in the Expert interface, the window above will appear. After DVD-Cloner scans it for one or two minutes, you will see all the video information of this DVD, including the main film and special features. 
You can select any chapter you want to copy, removing extra features occupying the disc space. The selected chapter can be previewed by clicking the "play" button. At last, confirm this change with "OK".
