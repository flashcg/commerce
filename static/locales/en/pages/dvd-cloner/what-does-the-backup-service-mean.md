### Q: What does the backup service mean?

A:
It is a service of SWREG and REGNOW, Registration Backup Service. For more details, please go to: https://usd.swreg.org/rbs.html
To remove the service, please just click on REMOVE next to the US $6.95 on the page:
https://usd.swreg.org/cgi-bin/s.cgi?s=4680&d=Standard&c=USD&x=0&r=1&lang...
you can remove the service fee: $6.95 .
Usually, you don't have to pay for the service. We will keep your registeration information and download file for you. If you can't find your registeration information or dont' know how and where to download DVD CLONER, please just contact us. Therefore it is really optional.
