### Q: How to burn video files into the DVD format?

A:
First, RM or RMVB formats, video programs, the need for conversion into MPEG 2 format, is able to import NERO burn a DVD video discs.

For this format conversion, can be used on Japan's converter software TMPGEnc 2.53 this the best picture quality, but need to advance the installation of two plug-in, or can we RM RMVB format conversion of video into MPEG 2 format. Or use WINAVI VIDEO CONVERTER, do not need to install the plug-in, direct conversion can, but the quality into the software that Japan's small.

Second, MP3, WAV, AC3, WMA, m4a. Is not video format, that is to say, these things with the video image is not in any way related things.
In particular, AC3, is a standard surround-sound, not a video or audio "formats."

MP3,WAV,WMA,M4A,MP3, WAV, WMA, M4A, are the audio format, which means they are sound, burn to DVD blank discs But can, but no images! Thus there is no natural video format conversion problems.

Third, AVI, MPEG format, is the video format, but the two formats in use NERO burn DVD video discs, the conversion is not directly import on the line, NERO software understanding of the two formats, can be directly The burning.

It should be noted, AVI into the burn before, NERO it can be automatically converted into MPEG 2 format, burn again. Nature will burn out worse than the original definition. If you pursuit of quality, then to use the above said that the small Japanese software conversion into MPEG 2, to burn, but small Japanese software conversion of AVI, does not require installation of plug-in. Directly on the line for conversion.

The MPEG format, directly into NERO can start the burn.

Fourth, the burning question: NERO use the "Create your own DVD video disc option, you can burn out the DVD drive can play video on a CD-ROM in this good video disc recorders, there are two Folders, AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS.

AUDIO_TS this folder is empty, is left to the audio DVD discs to use.

VIDEO_TS this folder, it retains the film's DVD video files, of which VOB file formats, video is the main document, this document contains the main MPEG2 video data format film, multi-channel audio data, different scenes of data, data, and so on the menu of information.

IFO files, including on how or when and where to find and play VOB data some of the information. This document is a normal player VOB data essential to an important document.

BUP files, the IFO is a backup file, so that in case of damage after the IFO still normal player VOB files.

These three types of documents, are used in the NEOR into MPEG 2 format video files, DVD video disc recorders in the process of the formation of NERO coding automatically. People do not need to specify.
