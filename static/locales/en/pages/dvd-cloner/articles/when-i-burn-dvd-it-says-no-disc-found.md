Please try the following steps:

2.Please make sure that your DVD burner supports the DVDr/rw disc you use.
3.Please select 4x or 1xas burning speed in the Advanced Option and use 4x namebrand DVDr/rw disc, such as Memorex, Fujifilm, or Verbatim for example.
4. If you use DVDrw disc, please format it before burning.
