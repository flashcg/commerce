### Q: I want to know whether DVD-Cloner can read region free discs.

A:
Yes. It can read region free discs and convert DVD movies into region free discs or region all discs. You can play the cloned discs on your DVD-ROM.

You can't play region 1 discs on your DVD-ROM. Usually DVD-ROM can change the region code for 5 times, and the region code will be locked on the region that you change the last time.
