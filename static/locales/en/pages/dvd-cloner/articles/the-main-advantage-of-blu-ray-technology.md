### Q: What's the main advantage of Blu-ray technology?

A:
The main advantage of Blu-ray technology is its capability of storing massive amounts of data in one disc. Blu-ray technology will enable users to store an average of 25GB-27GB worth of data into just one layer. This is equivalent to 4 hours worth of HD video and audio. Moreover, Blu-ray dual layer discs will have a storage capacity of up to 54GB. Research on Blu-ray discs with up to four layers and with storage capacities of up to 200GB is currently underway.
