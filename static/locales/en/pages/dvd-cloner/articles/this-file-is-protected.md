### Q: I have turned off all the security on my computer but when I click on the link to get the download of DVD-Cloner, all I get is: STOP this file is protected.

A:
Please use professional download software to download it again at https://www.dvd-cloner.com/download.html. You can refer to the professional download software at http://www.amazesoft.com/
If you have Windows Service Pack 2 or other protective software installed (i.e. anti-spyware, anti-virus and/or firewalls), you may need to disable all security settings on your PC. This adjustment will permit the download popup box to appear. When both download and registration are complete reset your original security settings.
