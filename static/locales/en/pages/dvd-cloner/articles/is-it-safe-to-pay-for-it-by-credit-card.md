### Q: Is it safe to pay for it by credit card?

A:
If you feel worried about paying for it by credit card, you can choose to pay by check/money or order by phone.
If you want to pay by check/money, please click the "buy" button on the software which will lead you to the SWREG's order page. You can find the check/money order/wire/paypal option there.
You can choose "order by phone" option at https://www.regsoft.net/regsoft/vieworderpage.php3?productid=55530
To order with money order is quiet easy. Just in https://www.dvd-cloner.com/order.html,select "order at SWREG.ORG",then follow the link, select "CHECK by US or UK checks or International Money Orders" option. You will get all information about buying with "money order/check".
