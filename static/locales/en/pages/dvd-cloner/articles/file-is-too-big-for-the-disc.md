### Q: "file is too big for the disc, and do I still want to burn?".....when I click "yes" it just cancels the whole operation.

A:
Please use expert interface and select 3.0GB as D5 Disc Size in Advanced Seutp, then try again. Or select "D9 to D5 movie only disc copy" function. If you use 1:1 option to backup a D9 movie, you need a D9 blank disc (8.5GB) to make a 1:1 copy.
