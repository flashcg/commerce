### Q: Application will not start, it just freezes on the opening screen.

A:
Please run DVD CLONER before putting the DVD into the DVD-ROM drive, after putting the source DVD into the DVD-ROM drive, if it still freezes. Please take out the DVD and run DVD CLONER again,then cancel the mark on "authenticate dvd region when start" in "advanced setup".
