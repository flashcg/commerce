### Q: When I try to use the option "Split to two DVD-5s function", it says it will delete the menu. How do I go about putting it onto two discs?

A:
Splitting a DVD-9 to two DVD-5 discs will separate the menu, the extra and the first half of the movie from the second half of the movie into two discs. If the movie is less than 4.5GB after removing the menu and the extra, it will be backed up into just one disc. A DVD-5 blank disc is 4.7GB.
