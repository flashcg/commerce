### Q: What kind of formats do Blu-ray discs support?

A:
Blu-ray discs are capable of supporting different file formats such as MPEG-2, MPEG-4 High Profile AVC and VC-1 coder decoders which enables the discs to store up to four hours worth of HDTV audio-video per layer. It is also capable of supporting the different multi-channel audio file formats such as the different file formats of Dolby and DTS as well as PCM audio file formats. BD rewritable and recordable disc formats will also be backwards-compatible with older formats such as MPEG-2 while newer codecs will enable Blu-ray technology to support new file formats in the future. The integration of Java cross platform will also enable the Blu-ray disc to have interactive menus as well as the capability to add new content or updates such as new subtitles through the Internet.
