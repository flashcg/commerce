### Q: What should I do if I see ERR: skip bad sector?

A:
1. If the light of you DVD drive is on, it means it is normally working.

2. If the light is off, please cancel the reading , then try again.

3. If the light of the dvd drive stops flickering at "skiping bad sector", it means it fails to skip the bad sector, please then try to read the movie in another dvd rom.

Please change the "skip bad sector value" option to 2000 or 5000, which is in the advanced setup.
