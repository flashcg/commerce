### Q: Is it safe to purchase your software online?

A:
First of all, I am confident to tell that it is pretty safe to purchase online nowadays, and you can order from SWREG or REGNOW. We have been selling this program for ages. Please don't worry about it.
Secondly, you may know Paypal already. I would like to suggest you registering a Paypal account first. It is a very well-known agency which handles the money-transferring between customer's credit card bank and vendor. They are always on the customer's side.
