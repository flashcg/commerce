### Q: How to adjust the compression rate of a single video?

A:
You can get a better video quality of the copied DVD by adjusting the compression rate. In the Expert interface, select "Customized copy" and you will see all the video information of the DVD, including the main film and its special features.
If you want to adjust the compression rate, please follow the steps below:
1. Select the chapter you want to change the compression rate. You can preview it by clicking the "play" button.
2. Drag the slider in the lower left corner of this window to adjust the compression rate from 10% to 100%.
3. Click "OK". 
Note: Please pay attention to the size bar on the top. The burning will fail if the target size exceeds the disc's capacity.
