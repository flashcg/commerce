### Q: Is there a yearly fee for DVD-Cloner or is it a one time purchase?

A:
For the users of DVD-Cloner V:

The version you paid is valid for a life time, and the upgrade is free within 1 year since you ordered or paid to upgraded to DVD-Cloner V.

For the users of DVD-Cloner IV:

The payment of the software for the version you want to purchase is valid for a life time, as well as all the minor updates, such as from 4.10 to 4.20, from 4.20 to 4.30, etc.

But there is an exception, you would also be entitled for a free upgrade to a major version if a major version gets to be released during 1 year since your purchasing date, such as from version V to version VI.
