### Q: How long does it take for DVD-Cloner to copy a DVD?

A:
Copying time may vary with your computer configuration, burning speed and the content of the movie. Normally the copying time will range from 30 minutes to two hours. We recently performed a test copying a 6.92GB DVD-9 movie to a 4.7GB disc. It took about 35 minutes to finish the copying.
