### Q: Is there movie menu in the cloned DVD under "Split DVD-9 to two DVD-5s" copy mode?

A:
You can select either to save or remove the menu in "advance setup" window. If you select not to save it, DVD-Cloner VI will prompt you to insert the second DVD after the first DVD is copied and the movie title will be added to the second DVD for your convenience.
