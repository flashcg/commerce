### Q: It takes my DVD-Cloner two to four hours to copy a movie. Can I do something to speed it up?

A:

Please do as follows :

1 Please close other software before running DVD-Cloner.

2 Please choose the proper value for burning speed in the Advanced Option.

3 You can check whether there is virus on your PC.

4 You may try another original DVD to see if you get the same problem.

5 You'd better use some namebrand DVD+/-R/RW disc, such as Memorex, Fujifilm, or Verbatim.
