### Q: Why won't my copied DVD±RW disc play on the DVD drive, or DVD player?

A: 
Please check the followings:
1. Make sure your DVD drive, or DVD player supports the DVD±RW format.
2. If the copied DVD is a DVD±RW, please try copying the source DVD to a DVD±R disc, which is compatible with more DVD drives and DVD players.
