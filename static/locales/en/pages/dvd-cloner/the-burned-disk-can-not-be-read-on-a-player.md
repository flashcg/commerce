### Q: The burned disc can not be read on a player.

A:

Please use our new version and try the instructions below:

1.Please make sure that your DVD player supports the DVD+/-R/RW disc you use.

2.Please make sure your DVD player can play region all DVD disc because DVD-Cloner backs up DVD movie into region all disc.

3.You may play the disc on your PC with your DVD burner by PowerDVD or WinDVD and see if you get the same problem.

4.You may back up your DVD on your hard disk first, then play it with PowerDVD or WinDVD. Please test if you get the same problem.

5.Please select 4x or 1x as burning speed in the Advanced Option and use 4x namebrand DVD+/-R/RW disc, such as Memorex, Fujifilm, or Verbatim. If you burn a DVD-9 (8.5GB) blank disc, please use 2.4X as burning speed.

6.If you back up original DVD movie, please don't use "full dvd disc copy" which works with data disc or home made DVD video.

7.Or try other DVDs.
