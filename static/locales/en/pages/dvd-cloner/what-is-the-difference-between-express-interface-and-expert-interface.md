### Q: What's the difference between Express interface and Expert interface? Which interface should I use?

A:
Express interface is the easiest way to backup your DVDs. It takes only one click to finish the backup, especially suitable for beginners.
Expert interface is more professional and customized. You can make customized DVD copies in this interface.

If you are a novice of DVD-Cloner, or you know very little about computer, we recommend you use the Express operating interface.
If you are an experienced user of our product and want to try its various copy modes, then the Expert interface would be your ideal choice.
