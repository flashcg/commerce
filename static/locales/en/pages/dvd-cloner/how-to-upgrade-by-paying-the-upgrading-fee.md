### Q: How to upgrade by paying the upgrading fee?

A:
Please uninstall the old version and download and install DVD-Cloner VI on your PC from the download page

https://www.dvd-cloner.com/download.html

You can download at any mirror site.

Then install on your computer. Please run DVD-Cloner VI and register with your register code and register email. You will get a pop-up window. Please click on the Upgrade Now. Please pay $29.99 to get upgrade. After the payment, you may register with your code and email address. Then you can enjoy the new version.

Or you may pay the upgrading fee by the following link:

Please feel free to remove the Registration Backup Service, $3.85. You don't need the service. We will keep your registration information for you.
