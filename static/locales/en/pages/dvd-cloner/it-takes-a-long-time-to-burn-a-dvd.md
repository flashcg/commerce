### Q: It takes a long time to burn a DVD.

A:
The cloning time depends on the computer configuration, the burning speed and the content of the source DVD. Normally, the cloning time ranges from 30 minutes to two hours. We recently performed a test using a DVD-9 of Jumanji. The original disc held 6.92GB, and was cloned to a target disc of 4.7GB. The total cloning time was 35 minutes.
