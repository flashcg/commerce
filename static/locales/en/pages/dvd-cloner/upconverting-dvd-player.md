### Q: What is upconverting DVD player?

A:
An upconverting DVD player will have some kind of HD video output, probably DVI-D or HDMI. It does not play Blu-ray or HD DVD discs; only standard DVDs. The player contains circuitry to produce an HD resolution video (720p or 1080i, possibly both) from the original NTSC (or perhaps PAL) 480i video on the standard DVD. That circuitry is equivalent to the DVD player software, except that it does the math on a chip whose sole purpose is to do that math, as opposed to doing it on your general purpose CPU.
