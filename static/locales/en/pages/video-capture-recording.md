## A New Way to Download, Copy and Backup the Latest Streaming and DVD/Blu-ray Movies and TV series.

Over the years, Streaming and DVD/Blu-ray movie discs encryption technology has been continuously upgraded. Using software for replication and backing up Streaming and DVD/Blu-ray is increasingly more difficult than before.

In addition, more and more the latest and most popular movies and TV series are released through streaming media, no longer stored on the DVD/Blu-ray discs. It seems that the Era of DVD is giving way to Blu-ray, Video-on-Demand and Internet streaming. Therefore, we can not backup all our favorite videos just by DVD/Blu-ray drives any more.

So, is there any ways to get the encrypted or streaming processed movies and TV series?

The answer is to use a video capture and recording device. In fact, video capture devices are very practical. With it, we will no longer be bothered by the encryption and streaming processing technology.

Just connect a video capture device to Streaming and DVD/Blu-ray/streaming media player via HDMI cables, and we can quickly and easily record the lastest movies and TV series. No PC is needed in the whole process!

No matter where the movies/series are stored on, DVD/Blu-ray discs/Set-Top Box/any streaming media player, we can record and keep all these videos permanently.

The recording capacity of a digital video recorder seems immense when it’s just installed, but after a few months, hard drives don't seem so big anymore. You really need a solution to free up your DVR for future recording. The fastest and easiest way is to record your recorded shows to USB storage devices or PC with a standalone video recorder hooked up to the DVR unit. Let’s talk about it.

### The first thing you need to know is how to strip "HDCP"

The Best free way to crack the devices and strip HDCP protection is using [Open PassDCP](/open-passdcp/) software.
