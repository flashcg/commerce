### Q: I have tried twice to convert and transfer the video file to my iPod. Both times the file transfers and the movie is available on my iPod, but all my other 8500 songs, 3 videos, and 50 music videos are in my iPod but inaccessible?

A: Please try following steps :
1. In the "Setup" window, set the Codec to H264, Width to 480 and Height to 360 (You need to input the number 360 manually).
2. Open the "Advanced" window to set the Video Bitrate to 1500
3. Transport the converted files with iTunes
