### Q: When I entered the registration information, a message popped up and said invalid registration code, what should I do?

A: Different from DVD-CLONER, customers need their accurate registration code and registration name to register DVD-TO-IPOD. Fleximage Converter DVD-TO-IPOD can be registered offline. Meanwhile, instead of typing in the long registration information , remember to suggest customers to copy and paste their registration information.
