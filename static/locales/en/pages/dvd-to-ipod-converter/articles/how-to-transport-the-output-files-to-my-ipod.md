### Q: How to transport the output files to my iPod?

A: iPod-Cloner can transport video files from PC to iPod directly. You needn't install iTunes or other software.

If no iPod is connected to your PC, the iPod icon on the operating interface will be gray. 

 

If an iPod is connected to PC, the icon will be activated. You may click it to select "directly transport video files to ipod after conversion". If you select it, the icon will turn blue, otherwise it'll be light blue.
 

  and     

The transporting time depends on the file size.

Note: You need to close the automatic synchronization function of iTunes and select "enable disk use" (you can find it in the summary page after starting iTunes).Otherwise the output files can not be put into your iPod.
