### Q: I am trying to convert my movies with DVD-TO-IPOD, but it is giving me an error "Cannot read IFO file!"

A: When the original movie isn't placed in the dvd drive properly, this problem will happen. So please try to place it into the dvd drive properly again to see if there will still be an error message like that.If the same problem still exists, please tell me the name of the movie and the publishing studio, and I will then be able to help you more.
