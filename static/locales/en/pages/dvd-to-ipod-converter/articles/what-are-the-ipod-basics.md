### Q: What are the iPod Basics?

A: An Apple product works with both Mac and Windows machines. Since it's the top-selling media player in the United States, probably the big question is: What makes it different from any other digital media player? The answer will differ depending on who you ask. Some might say it's the form factor -- the 80-GB iPod classic is less than half an inch (1.4 centimeters) deep and weighs about 4.9 ounces (140 grams). For comparison, the Zen Portable Media Center from Creative is 1.06 inches (2.7 centimeters) deep, weighs 12 ounces (340 grams) and has only 20 GB of hard drive space

According to Apple CEO Steve Jobs in a Newsweek interview, "It was developed out of necessity for the Mini, because there wasn't enough room [for the buttons]. But the minute we experienced it we just thought, 'My God, why didn't we think of this sooner?'" And then, some might tell you the greatest thing in the world is the super-tight iPod/iTunes integration (which, ironically, others will curse until the day they die).
