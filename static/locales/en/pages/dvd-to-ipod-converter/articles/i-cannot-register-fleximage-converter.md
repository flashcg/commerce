### Q: I can't register Fleximage Converter for iPod with the registration information in a regular way, what should I do?

A: Please run Fleximage Convertor for iPod on your PC. Then press "TRIAL" button and you will get a popped up page. On the top of the page is your SERIAL NUMBER, please send it to me. I will make a key file for you to register manually.
