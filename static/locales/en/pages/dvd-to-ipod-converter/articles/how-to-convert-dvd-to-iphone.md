### Q: How to convert DVD to iPhone/iPod/PSP/Zune/Apple TV/Phone/Xbox/Zen/AVI/MPEG?

A: Step1. Insert your DVD disc into your DVD-Rom, then run the software, click "Load DVD" button and add the DVD file. You can also add DVD/IFO from your hard disk.

Step2. This software can convert DVD to various video formats such as MPEG-4, AVI, WMV, FLV, 3GP, VOB, etc. Click the "Format"drop down list to select a format. If you want to copy DVD to computer in 1:1 lossless quality, please select "Lossless DVD Copy (*.vob)".

If you don't know much about mobile players, just select a format according to the name of your mobile player. For example, if you want to copy DVD to the coming iPhone, just select "iPhone Video MPEG-4 (*.mp4)", and the default setting works great. If you want to customize the output video, you can click the "Settings" button next to the format field to open the Settings window and set video resolution, frame rate, bit rate, encoder, etc.

Step3. Select Subtitle and Audio
Regular DVD movies usually have several subtitles such as English, French, German, etc. You can select one you prefer. You can also delete the subtitle by selecting "No Subtitle". Selecting Audio is the same.
After the above steps, click "Start" to start conversion.

Tips:
If you want to copy DVD to iPod, this software has a free iPod Copy Manager; it can help you transfer the converted video to iPod directly without iTunes. Just connect your iPod to computer, click "Tools" -> "iPod Copy Manager", then you will see a pop up window (See the figure below), the left pane is the video and music list on your computer, the right pane is the file list on your iPod (you also can copy files from iPod to computer, it's useful if your computer crashes or you lose iTunes library), select the files you want to sync and click the right arrow button to finish the transfer. For PSP, this software also provides a PSP Video Manager, click "Tool"-> PSP Video Manager, it fully supports all PSP firmware version (former 3.0 or 3.0 later), and the steps to transfer files to PSP is very similar.
