### Q: DVD cloner never recognizes my DVD when inserted in the drive. The DVD player launches like it is supposed to and the drive letter for the DVD drive shows up in the iPod-Cloner drop down list but always says "No Movie".

A:
If this is the problem of iPod-Cloner, please see if you have selected the option "Enable DVD driver's auto-run fuction" in Setup. Please select the option "Enable DVD driver's auto-run fuction" in Setup then reboot your PC and try again.
