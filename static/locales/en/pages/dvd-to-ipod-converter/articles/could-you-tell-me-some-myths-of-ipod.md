### Q: Could you tell me some myths of iPod?

A: If you use iPod as my digital-media player, you can only download music from the iTunes Store.

Not true. You can download music from other sites (as long as the site doesn't use Windows Media DRM -- iPod isn't compatible with that encoding). If you use iPod as my digital-media player, you can only use the iTunes software as your jukebox.Not true. While iPod is made to work with the iTunes software, there are other jukeboxes out there that you can use with your iPod. If you download MP3 or WAV files to your iPod, they'll be converted into a proprietary audio format.Downloading files to an iPod doesn't change the format. iPod can play MP3, WAV, AAC, AIFF, Apple Lossless and Audible audio files.
