### Q: I am sure I entered the right registration information, but I still can't register the software, what should I do?

A: In this case, we need to make a key file for customers to register manually. First of all, we need to ask for the serial number. Here is the way of how to find serial number: Please run DVD-TO-IPOD 1.1 on your PC, then press "TRIAL" button and you will get a popped up page. On the top of the page is your SERIAL NUMBER. Then, use our key file making link to make a key file for customers with every detailed information requested in it.
