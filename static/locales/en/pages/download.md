    We'd like to turn DVD-Cloner 2020 into a multi-language application. Welcome to translate it to your native language. The translator will receive DVD-Cloner 2020's registration code as a reward. If you are interested in it, please <a class="text-danger" href="/knowledge/How-to-create-multi-language-text-for-a-DVD-Cloner-interface_381.html">Click HERE</a> to learn more.

    Please don't translate the following languages. Here is a multi-language translation list that we have received.
    
    <img alt="English" src="{imageUrl}icon/lan_usa.png"> <img alt="Italian" src="{imageUrl}icon/italy.png">&nbsp;<img alt="Poland" src="{imageUrl}icon/poland.png"> <img alt="chinese" src="{imageUrl}icon/china.png">

    Since there will be lots of translation versions of each language, we can not assure that every translator will get a free program. If you have any question, please feel free to email to <a href="mailto:support@dvd-cloner.com">support@dvd-cloner.com</a>

    We need your participation!
