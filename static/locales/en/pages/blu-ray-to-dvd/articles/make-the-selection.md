### Q: If there are different source files, how do I make the selection?

A: If you want to burn the files on the drive, please click “Split Blu-ray movie to multi-DVDs”. If the source is the files on the hard disc drive, please click “Split M2TS/TS file to multi-DVDs”. If you want to continue the unfinished work, please click “Open an existing project to continue”.
Note: This function is only available in the Professional version.
