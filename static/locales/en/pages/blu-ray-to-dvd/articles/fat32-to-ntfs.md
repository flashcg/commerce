### Q: If my hard disk is FAT32, will there be any error message when I burn a disc? How to change the file system from FAT32 to NTFS?

A: If the hard disk is FAT32, the error message "The temporary directory needs to be set on the NTFS partition" will appear.
To run Blu-ray to DVD, there must be a NTFS high-capacity hard disk.
To change the file system to NTFS, right click the disc name in Windows Explorer then click "format". In the "file system" option, select "NTFS" and click the Start button to begin formatting.

Note: After formatting, all data in the disk will get lost. Please save your useful data ahead.
