### Q: What can Blu-ray to DVD do?

A: Blu-ray to DVD is Blu-ray movie splitting software, which can split and burn a Blu-ray movie to multiple DVDs. Under the circumstance that Blu-ray disc is expensive and Blu-ray movies canâ€™t be played by common hardware, the release of Blu-ray to DVD solves these problems. Now users can enjoy Blu-ray high definition movies with their existing playing devices. Under certain circumstances, a third party decryption application, like AnyDVD HD, is needed.
