### Q: What is AVCHD?

A: AVCHD (Advanced Video Codec High Definition) is a high-definition recording format for use in digital tapeless camcorders.
AVCHD (AVC-HD, AVC HD) employs AVC video codec with inter-frame long GOP compression, and AC-3 or PCM audio codec. A wide range of frame sizes and rates, both interlaced and progressive, is supported. Compared to HDV camcorders based on MPEG-2 codec, AVCHD camcorders achieve higher compression and lower data rates with comparable image quality.
