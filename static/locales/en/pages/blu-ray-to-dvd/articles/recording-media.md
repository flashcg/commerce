### Q: Which recording media can AVCHD use?

A: AVCHD specification allows using several kinds of recording media, in particular recordable DVD disks, memory cards and hard disk drives.
DVD disks is the original media specified in AVCHD standard. To reduce camcorder size, only smaller 8 cm disks, sometimes called miniDVDs, are allowed. Recording capacity ranges from 1.4 GB for a single-sided single layer disk to 5.2 GB for a double-sided double layer disk.
HDD was added as a possible media to AVCHD specification shortly after the new video standard has been announced. Capacity ranges from 30 GB to 120 GB.
Memory cards are a promising media for tapeless camcorders. The capacity of memory cards is constantly increasing, while prices are falling. AVCHD supports SD/SDHC memory cards, and "Memory Stick" cards.
