### Q: Which version should I use?

A: If you only want to split a Blu-ray movie to multiple DVDs, Express version is enough.
If you want to add the menu navigation in the target DVDs or make selectable burning and customized settings, please use the Professional version. Its powerful functions will suit your various requirements.
