### Q: What kind of disc can Blu-ray to DVD make?

A: Blu-ray to DVD can burn Blu-ray movies to AVCHD high-definition DVDs. They can be played back in PLAYSTATION3, PCs and some Blu-ray players.

Note: Regular AVCHD doesnâ€™t support menu navigation. If a menu is added, the disc can only be played back in PCs and some Blu-ray players, not in PLAYSTATION 3.
