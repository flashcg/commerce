### Q: What audio codecs will Blu-ray support?

A: 

Linear PCM (LPCM) - up to 8 channels of uncompressed audio. (mandatory)

Dolby Digital (DD) - format used for DVDs, 5.1-channel surround sound. (mandatory)

Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) - extension of Dolby Digital, 7.1-channel surround sound. (optional)

Dolby TrueHD - lossless encoding of up to 8 channels of audio. (optional)

DTS Digital Surround - format used for DVDs, 5.1-channel surround sound. (mandatory)

DTS-HD High Resolution Audio - extension of DTS, 7.1-channel surround sound. (optional)

DTS-HD Master Audio - lossless encoding of up to 8 channels of audio. (optional)

Please note that this simply means that Blu-ray players and recorders will have to support playback of these audio codecs, it will still be up to the movie studios to decide which audio codec(s) they use for their releases.
