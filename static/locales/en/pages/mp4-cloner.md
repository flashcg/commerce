    text: Do you have many video files scattered everywhere on the PC recorded with our HDMI video recorder? MP4-Cloner is a solution for you to burn them to a DVD/Blu-ray movie disc. It converts video files to DVD/Blu-ray video format first and then creates DVD/Blu-ray movie discs. Besides, if you don't have a blank DVD or Blu-ray disc at hand, it gives you another choice to burn the videos to an ISO image file or movie folder temporarily for later burn.
